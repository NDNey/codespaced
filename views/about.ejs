        CodeSpaced is a flashcard program that uses spaced repetition, a technique
        supported by cognitive science for fast and long-lasting memorization.
        This idea uses dynamic flashcards for programmers to have the option to
        ask themselves how to solve a specific challenge or write a specific
        method, testing whether they are using the correct syntax. 
      </p>
      <p class="col-11">The app gives
        the user the option to use a built-in code editor to create the front and
        back of the card. When the user decides to study that specific card, the
        user will have to match the syntax in the back of the card and submit the
        final answer. An algorithm runs in the back-end of the app to identify how
        often the user will need to practice that specific card. The goal is that
        the user will have a better chance to retain the syntax indefinitely in
        memory as well as develop muscle memory for the next time the user has to
        type the code.</p>
